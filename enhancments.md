# Enhancements

This document describes the suggestions for enhancing the performance of the UeXL. This document provides general guidelines irrespective of any language. It may contains operators not supported by UeXL, but are supported by other languages.

## Logical short-circuiting

This is a technique in which the evaluation of an expression stops as soon as the final result can be determined. For example, in the expression `x && y`, if `x` is `false`, then the result of the expression is `false` regardless of the value of `y`. In this case, the evaluation of `y` is unnecessary. Similarly, in the expression `x > 0 && y > 0`, if the value of `x` is determined to be less than or equal to `0`, the expression `y > 0` will not be evaluated as the final result is already determined to be false, regardless of the value of `y`. This can save a significant amount of computation time and resources, especially when the evaluation of the second expression is expensive.

Logical short-circuiting can also be applied to other types of operators, such as bitwise operators.

For example, in the expression x & y, if the value of `x` is determined to be `0`, the value of y will not be evaluated, as the result of the expression will be `0` regardless of the value of `y`.

Similarly, in the expression `x | y`, if the value of x is determined to be non-zero, the value of `y` will not be evaluated, as the result of the expression will be non-zero regardless of the value of `y`.

Another example is the ternary operator `a? b:c`, where the value of `b or c` is only evaluated if the value of a is true or false respectively.

There are other types of operators where short-circuiting can be applied, such as the null-coalescing operator `??`. This operator is used to determine if a value is null or undefined, and if it is, it returns an alternative value.

For example, in the expression `a ?? b`, if the value of `a` is non-null, the value of `b` will not be evaluated, as the result of the expression will be `a` regardless of the value of `b`.

Another example is the short-circuit evaluation in the functional languages, where the evaluation of the function stops when a certain condition is met.

It's worth noting that different programming languages have their own ways of implementing short-circuiting and some may not have it at all. But the basic idea behind short-circuiting is to stop the evaluation of an expression as soon as the final result can be determined, in order to save time and resources.

## Memoization

Memoization is a technique used to improve the performance of an expression parser by storing the results of previously evaluated expressions in a cache or lookup table, so that they can be reused later.

The idea behind memoization is to avoid recomputing the same expressions over and over again. Instead, the result of an expression is cached and can be looked up in constant time when the same expression is encountered again.

For example, in the expression `x + y + z`, if `x` and `y` are both variables, then the result of `x + y` can be stored in a variable and reused in the expression `x + y + z`. This can be done in a similar way for expressions that are not commutative, such as `x - y - z`.

Memoization can be implemented in several ways, for example by using a hash table, where the input of the function is hashed and the output is stored as a value to that key, or by using a dictionary where the key is the input and the value is the output of the function. Memoization can also be implemented recursively where the function calls itself with the memoized value.

It's worth noting that memoization can consume a lot of memory, especially if the number of possible input values is large or if the results are large data structures. Therefore, it's important to use memoization judiciously and to monitor the memory usage of the program.

## Constant folding

This is a technique in which the result of an expression is computed at compile time if all of the operands are constants. For example, in the expression `1 + 2`, the result of the expression is `3` and can be computed at compile time.

It works by identifying and evaluating expressions that contain only constant operands at compile-time, rather than evaluating them at runtime.

For example, in the expression 1 + 2, the result of the expression is 3 and can be computed at compile time, so the expression can be replaced by the constant value 3. This can help to eliminate unnecessary computation at runtime and can also result in smaller and more efficient code.

It's also related to optimization, where the constant values are replaced by their values in the code, and the operations are simplified.

## Node Depth Reduction

Unlike constant folding, this is a technique in which the depth of the AST is reduced by moving the computation of an expression to the higher level if the parent node contains unnecessary nodes. For example, in the expression `((x + (y + z)))`, the result of the expression is the same as `x + y + z` and the depth of the AST can be reduced by removing the unnecessary nodes.

 It works by simplifying the AST by removing unnecessary nodes and combining the computation of sub-expressions at higher levels. This can help to reduce the number of operations required to evaluate the expression, and also make it easier to understand and optimize.

It is also related to optimization, where the structure of the tree, can be simplified. This can also help to improve readability and maintainability of the code.

It's worth noting that this technique is not always possible or desirable, as it may change the semantics of the expression. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the simplification preserves the correct behavior of the original expression.
